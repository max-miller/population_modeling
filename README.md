## Population Modelling

Some examples of building out various sorts of population models and displaying the results with either interactive components or as dynamic visuals, or both.

The Lotke-Volterra equations describe hypothetical populations of predator and prey species, and how one population influences the growth of the other. Presented as an animated visual of the populations playing out over time and as a simple dashboard allowing the user to choose the values of the parameters.

John Conway's Game of Life is presented in two versions, one visualized in the Curses library and the other using Matplotlib as both the visualization and input method.

Lastly are a some animations of a simple SIR epidemiological model.
